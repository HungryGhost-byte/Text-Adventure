# Text-Adventure
Python based text adventure game!

Simply choose a number corresponding to the decision you want to make to proceed.  Multiple paths and dead ends!  Can you get the best ending?

I used this project to get me comfortable with the following in Python:
User input
Strings
Boolean values
Dictionaries
Functions
Nested If Statements
